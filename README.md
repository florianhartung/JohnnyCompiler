# JohnnyCompiler

A simple compile for the [Johnny Simulator](https://osdn.net/projects/sfnet_johnnysimulator/downloads/Manuals%20(Multi-Lang)/Johnny-Manual-EN.pdf/), which is a simplified version of the von-Neumann Computer.

# Why?

The purpose of this very simple compiler is to show how our readable code is translated to machine code
